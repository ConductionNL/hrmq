 * check-bundle-freshness.js — assert js/ was built from the src/ on disk.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * On 2026-08-19 the shipped bundle was 19 days older than the manifest it was
 * supposed to contain, and had been compiled against a dependency version the
 * lockfile no longer pinned. Every source-level check passed. The app was
 * broken in production for its primary navigation surface, and the source was
 * innocent — a class of defect no linter, unit test or schema validator can
 * see, because none of them read the artefact that actually ships.
 *
 * The one instrument that would have caught it is a comparison between what is
 * built and what it was built from.
 *
 * WHY MTIME, AND WHERE IT IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY
 * ------------------------------------------
 * `js/` is git-ignored, so its mtime is only ever moved by an actual build —
 * never by a checkout, rebase or pull. That makes it a real "when was this
 * built" signal LOCALLY.
 *
 * `src/`'s working-tree mtime is NOT trustworthy the same way: a fresh clone
 * stamps every file with the clone time, so on CI every source file looks
 * newer than any bundle and this check would fail every run for no reason.
 * So the source side uses git's own record — the last COMMIT time touching
 * src/ — which survives a clone intact.
 *
 * Neither signal exists in a git-less deploy (an unpacked release tarball).
 * There the check reports UNKNOWN and exits 0 rather than inventing a verdict:
 * a check that cannot see its subject must say so, not guess.

 * has no git, gets UNKNOWN and exit 0 -- and an unpacked release tarball is
 * precisely what an operator runs. A content hash needs no git and no clock.
 *
 * A MISSING sidecar is a FAILURE here, not an UNKNOWN. The default mode is
 * allowed to shrug because it genuinely cannot see its subject; this mode is
 * asked for by name, and answering "cannot tell" to a direct question about a
 * shipped artefact is how a stale bundle gets waved through.
