/**
 * Resolves a time entry's reference day and its hours, in either booking shape.
 *
 * A `TimeEntry` is recorded one of two ways, and this is the only place that
 * decides which:
 *
 * - **Clocked** — `startedAt` and `endedAt` are both present, and `hours` is
 *   derived from `(endedAt − startedAt − breakMinutes)`. This is humaniq's own
 *   shape and every refusal in it is unchanged.
 * - **Booked to a day** — neither is present, and a `date` plus an explicit
 *   positive `hours` stand in. This is what pipelinq and planninq record;
 *   neither captures clock times, so an owner that required them could only
 *   have taken their bookings by fabricating a start and an end that nobody
 *   measured.
 * - **Running** — `startedAt` is present, `endedAt` is not, and `origin` says
 *   `timer`. The work has not finished, so there are no hours yet: the entry
 *   derives `0` and takes its real figure when the timer stops and the write
 *   becomes clocked.
 *
 * WHY `origin` AND NOT JUST THE MISSING END. A booking that lost its end on the
 * way in looks exactly like a timer, and treating it as one would leave a
 * permanently running timer nobody started and no stop will ever close. The
 * marker makes the intent explicit, so a missing end without it is refused
 * exactly as it was.
 *
 * WHY NOT IN THE SCHEMA. JSON Schema's `required` cannot express "either this
 * pair or that field". The schema therefore marks all three optional and the
 * invariant lives here, next to the other refusals and their structured Dutch
 * messages.
 *
 * WHY NOT IN THE LISTENER. It was, and it took
 * {@see \OCA\Humaniq\Listener\TimeEntryStampListener} to an overall complexity
 * of 56 against a threshold of 50. The listener's job is the mutability guard
 * and the stamping; deciding what a booking MEANS is a separate question with
 * no dependencies, which is why this class has none.
