/**
 * The caller's running timer: starting one, stopping it, and finding it again.
 *
 * A running timer IS a time entry. `startedAt` is set, `endedAt` is absent, and
 * `origin` says `timer`. There is no second store, no session key and no cached
 * flag, so there is nothing that can disagree with the row: every surface that
 * can read humaniq's register can see that an object is being worked on right
 * now, on any device the person happens to be using.
 *
 * WHY THE SERVER DECIDES "ONE TIMER PER USER". A guard in the widget is not a
 * guard. Two tabs, two objects, a reload part-way through a request, or a second
 * device each get past it, and each one writes another open row that no stop
 * will ever close. The constraint spans rows the caller never sends, so it is
 * resolved here, from the caller's identity.
 *
 * WHY NOTHING TAKES AN ENTRY ID. Every method resolves the entry from the
 * calling user rather than from an id in the request, so there is no reference
 * for a caller to swap for someone else's (ADR-005 Rule 3). `stop()` takes no
 * arguments at all.
