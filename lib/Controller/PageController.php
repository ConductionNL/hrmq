/**
 * Humaniq Page Controller
 *
 * Renders the SPA shell that mounts the @conduction/nextcloud-vue manifest
 * renderer (CnAppRoot) and serves the bundled app manifest (ADR-024 §4). The
 * app stores no data of its own — the Timesheet/Expense pages are declarative
 * `type: "index"` / `type: "detail"` pages that read and write the humaniq
 * OpenRegister register directly via the library's object store; this
 * controller is pure SPA-shell glue.
 *
 * `index()` also stamps the caller's active administratie id (multi-
 * administratie, REQ-MULTI-004) as initial state so the frontend can seed the
 * page-level `cnWorkspaceContext` it provides at the SPA root BEFORE the
 * first paint — the Nextcloud-idiomatic `IInitialState`/`loadState()` pattern
 * (never a DOM data-attribute). This is what makes `@workspace.
 * activeAdministrationId?` filters in the manifest resolve on first load,
 * not only after a switch.

	 * so `App.vue` can seed `manifest.runtime.user.administrationMode` on first

	 * filters drop), the mode ALWAYS resolves to a concrete value
	 * (`standard` by default), so it is always stamped -- a `visibleIf`
