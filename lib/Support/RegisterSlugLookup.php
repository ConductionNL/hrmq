/**
 * RegisterSlugLookup — ask this instance which slug the humaniq register answers to.
 *
 * The register was renamed from `hrmq` to `humaniq` by
 * {@see \OCA\Humaniq\Repair\MigrateRegisterSlug}. That step runs PER INSTANCE,
 * so both slugs are live across the estate at once, and neither name is
 * correct on its own.
 *
 * Naming either one as a default is the defect this class exists to remove.
 * OpenRegister does not raise for a register that is not there: the row is
 * absent, so the read matches nothing and returns zero rows — byte for byte
 * what a healthy empty register returns. No exception, no 404, no log line.
 * Three call sites used to end in
 *
 *     $register = $this->appConfig->getValueString(Application::APP_ID, 'register', 'humaniq');
 *     return $register === '' ? 'hrmq' : $register;
 *
 * whose comment said the `hrmq` fallback was frozen, while the DEFAULT
 * argument beside it was already the canonical `humaniq`. On an instance that
 * has not run the repair step the register is still `hrmq`, so those readers
 * asked for a register nothing answers to, and reported it as no data.
 * See ConductionNL/openregister#3579.
 *
 * The answer comes from OpenRegister, because OpenRegister owns
 * `openregister_registers` and no consuming app can answer the question
 * without reaching into its storage. `RegisterSlugResolverInterface` is the
 * published probe for exactly that; the candidate list is not derivable, which
 * is why the contract takes one.
 *
 * AN OPENREGISTER TOO OLD FOR THAT CONTRACT IS NOT AN ABSENT REGISTER. The
 * first revision of this class returned null in that case, which put every
 * caller into its absent branch on an instance whose register was sitting
 * right there: the asset dialect repair step warned "register niet gevonden"
 * on every upgrade, and the leave-sell and payroll-run guards denied. When the
 * contract is missing the register table is read directly instead, through
 * `RegisterMapper::findIdsBySlugs()`. Only a register row still produces a
 * slug, so the guarantee this class exists for is intact.
 *
 * A STORED CONFIG VALUE WINS AND IS USED AS GIVEN. An admin who has named a
 * register has answered the question, and `MigrateRegisterSlug` re-points that
 * value when it still says `hrmq`, so a stored value is already this
 * instance's own truth. Resolving it a second time would only add a way to be
 * wrong. The `getValueString()` default is now the EMPTY STRING rather than a
 * slug: a default that is a slug is indistinguishable from an admin who chose
 * that slug, and it is what turned "nothing is configured" into "read the
 * canonical register" without anyone deciding so.
 *
 * NULL IS AN ANSWER, NOT AN ERROR. Callers must branch on it. An authorization
 * check denies; a report says it checked nothing and why. What no caller may
 * do is read with the canonical slug anyway and present the empty result as
 * real emptiness.

	 * THE FALLBACK FOR AN OPENREGISTER THAT PREDATES THE CONTRACT, AND THE

	 * OpenRegister #3571. No app in this fleet declares an `<app>` dependency
	 * in `appinfo/info.xml`, so humaniq is routinely installed beside an older
	 * OpenRegister, and on such an instance `resolver()` answers null. Treating
	 * that as "the register is absent" is what this class was built to stop
	 * doing with a slug, and it did it anyway with a null: measured on the dev
	 * instance 2026-09-11, where the register plainly exists under `humaniq`
	 * (register id 35, objects readable over the API) and every reader still
	 * got null. `MigrateAssetDialect` printed
	 * "Could not migrate Asset/AssetAssignment dialect: Het humaniq-register is
	 * niet gevonden op deze instance" on the upgrade, and the two lifecycle
	 * guards fail CLOSED on the same null, so leave-sell approvals and payroll
	 * run approvals were being denied for a register that is there.
	 *
	 * "OpenRegister cannot answer" and "the register is not here" are different
	 * facts. Only the resolver's own ABSENT answer means the second one; a
	 * missing resolver means ask another way. This is that other way, and it
	 * keeps the property that matters: it returns a slug only for a register
	 * row that actually exists, never a canonical guess.
	 *
	 * `RegisterMapper` is OpenRegister's internal storage, not a published
	 * contract, so it is reached defensively and never on the preferred path:
	 * where the contract exists it wins and this method is not called.
