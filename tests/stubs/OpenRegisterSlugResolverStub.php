/**
 * OpenRegister register-slug resolution contract — test-only mirror.
 *
 * {@see \OCA\Humaniq\Support\RegisterSlugLookup} asks OpenRegister which slug
 * this instance's humaniq register answers to, through the published contract
 * `OCA\OpenRegister\Contract\RegisterSlugResolverInterface`. Like the lifecycle
 * guard contract beside it, that is a SIBLING-APP dependency rather than a
 * composer package, so in the standalone PHPUnit suite (a bare php:8.3-cli
 * container with no Nextcloud and no OpenRegister) the real names are absent.
 *
 * Without them the lookup's `interface_exists()` availability check refuses
 * every call and answers "absent" unconditionally, so the RESOLVED path — the
 * one that decides what every guard and report does — could never be reached
 * by a test. A suite that can only exercise the failure branch reports the same
 * green whether the success branch works or not.
 *
 * UNLIKE the name-only ObjectService marker, this mirrors the REAL API, because
 * the lookup calls it: `resolve()` returns a resolution whose `slug` is read and
 * whose `isResolved()` is branched on. It is a method-for-method copy of
 * openregister@development lib/Contract/RegisterSlugResolverInterface.php and
 * lib/Contract/RegisterSlugResolution.php, INCLUDING the parameter names, which
 * are load-bearing: the lookup calls `resolve(canonical: ..., candidates: ...)`
 * by name, so a renamed parameter here would pass a test the real contract
 * fails.
 *
 * Loaded ONLY from tests/bootstrap.php, behind an interface_exists() check, so
 * the real OpenRegister contract always wins on a live instance. Never in
 * composer.json's autoload map — a stub on an autoloaded path can shadow the
 * real class in production.
