/**
 * OpenRegister RegisterMapper NAME stub — test-only.
 *
 * `RegisterSlugLookup::slugFromRegisterTable()` establishes availability with
 * `class_exists('OCA\OpenRegister\Db\RegisterMapper')`, the same ADR-083
 * pattern the sibling `OpenRegisterSchemaMapperStub` docblock explains. In the
 * standalone PHPUnit suite (a bare php:8.3-cli container with no Nextcloud and
 * no OpenRegister) the real class is absent, so that guard would refuse every
 * call and no test could reach the branch that decides what an instance with a
 * pre-contract OpenRegister does.
 *
 * THIS DECLARES A NAME AND NOTHING ELSE. It is never constructed and never
 * stands in for behaviour: the tests inject their own fake register mapper
 * through the container, and the lookup reaches it duck-typed with
 * `method_exists()`.
 *
 * Loaded ONLY from tests/bootstrap.php, behind a class_exists() check, so the
 * real OpenRegister class always wins on a live instance. Never in
 * composer.json's autoload map.
