/**
 * TimeEntryHoursDeriver unit tests
 *
 * The one place that decides what a booking MEANS, in all three shapes it can
 * arrive in: clocked (a start and an end), booked to a day (a date and a number
 * of hours), and running (a start, no end, and the timer marker).
 *
 * The class had no test at all before the running shape was added, which is the
 * reason every refusal in it is asserted here and not only the new ones: a
 * change to the running branch that broke the clocked one would otherwise have
 * been invisible.
