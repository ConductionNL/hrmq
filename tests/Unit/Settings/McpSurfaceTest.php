/**
 * The MCP surface humaniq declares, and everything it refuses.
 *
 * ADR-063 rules that an app declares a per-schema `x-openregister-mcp` block
 * and OpenRegister derives the tools; the app hand-writes none. humaniq had no
 * MCP surface at all before this, and it is the sharpest privacy case in the
 * fleet: its schemas hold BSNs, IBANs, gross salaries, payslips with per-employee
 * tax withholdings, dismissal reasons, severance amounts, candidate CVs, and
 * sick-leave cases with Wet verbetering poortwachter milestones, which is
 * health data under AVG art. 9. The derived surface has no field-level
 * projection, so a `get` returns the whole object.
 *
 * The design question was therefore not what can be exposed but what is left
 * once everything special-category, remunerative and identity-bearing is
 * removed. The answer is 6 schemas of 57, read-only, and that thinness is the
 * point.
 *
 * These tests exist because that decision is one careless block away from being
 * undone, and nothing else in the build would notice. A `create` verb on
 * Expense, or an MCP block on Employee, is a config edit that passes every
 * other check in this repository.
